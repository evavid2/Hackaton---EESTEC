# Polite and fast email generator using OpenAI

This is a demo app using OpenAI Api, developed by Eva Vidmar, Julija Stopar and Jure Malič at EESTEC Hackaton 2022. The use of this app is to
generate email fast and with a polite tone. The user only needs to provide basic information and the app generates a polite email, that the user can accept or reject. The purpose is to help people better understand each other through email with no hard feelings and spend less time thinking about writting polite and appropriate mail.
