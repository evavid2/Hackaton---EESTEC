# Datasets

The challenge will be divided in two parts. Therefore, two different datasets will 
be available, delivered, collected and obtained by [Medius d.o.o.](https://medius.si). 

Both datasets consist of different leakage scenarios, they both include data such as:

* leakage (4 different levels) 
* operator changes in pipeline system (4 different levels)
* missing data 

All signals are recorded from micro-turbines, and present the:

* pressure[bar],
* turbine load[mA,
* current[mA],
* turbine voltage[V],
* turbine speed[rpm]

The team members will be able to download data from provided url on the challenge start time.
